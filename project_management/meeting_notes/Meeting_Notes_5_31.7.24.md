## Discussion Points
1. Dicussed whether tickets should come in with a known total time and hidden tasks or completely blank. The first option will ensure the project manager does not have too much to do and is not unfairly the best role in the game. The second option means the 'Plan' room will have workstations.
1. Should each game played be represented as an entire project or just a sprint? **This will be decided later**
1. Implement a grid-based movement
1. Make the tickets physical objects
