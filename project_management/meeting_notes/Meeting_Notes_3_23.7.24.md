## Meeting Details
- **Date:** 24/7/24
- **Time:** 10AM
- **Location:** CO242A
- **Attendees:** Rene, Anthony, Nate, Joseph, Kahu

## Stand up (done by all team members)

1. State what you have been working on since the last meeting
2. State any issues you are struggling with
3. Explain any road blocks you have been facing

## Agenda
- Review requirements (Group): add detail where necessary and prioritise based upon group consensus
- Stakeholder review (Joseph): hear update from the stakeholder
- Plan Sprint 2 (Anthony): review tasks on the backlog, assign tasks and add new tasks for this sprint

## Discussion Points
1. Reviewed requirements to add detail and specificity
2. The stakeholder said that we need to start with a methodology and create the idea from there, not the other way around.
3. Brainstormed game aspects we like and game ideas which will be compulsory for our game

##### Game Idea Aspects That we Like:

- Character burn out - characters blow up or become useless if they get burnt out
- Kanban 
- Tickets having priority
- Project manager with overarching control of board
- Random events such as workers getting sick or random tasks
- Blocks instead of tickets with different size and colour representing different ascents of a ticket such as difficulty and priority

##### Key Base Game Ideas (What our game must have):
- Move around game in multiplayer fashion
- Top down
- Kanban board that is the shape of the map
- Doors between the different rooms representing Kanban buckets
- All players can walk anywhere between the rooms
- Each room has a number of relevant workstations
- Tickets come in which are worth points and have a variable number of tasks to be done at each workstation
- The amount of points that each ticket is worth is determined by the number of tasks and the difficulty of each task
- The goal is to get as many points as possible
- The game ends after x amount of time
- Burn out meter that is proportional to the number of tickets in the room
- Players are stunned and can't do anything for a short period of time if the burn out meter reaches the max
