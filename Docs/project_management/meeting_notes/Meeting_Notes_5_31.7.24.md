- Kahu to run through system architecture diagram and group discussion for additions and or changes
- Review open issues and brainstorm new ones (more research ones, dependency install issue is one, create boilerplate frontend and backend code are other ones)
- Group whiteboard session to create backend class diagram https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/manninalex/engr302-project/-/issues/14

## Discussion Points
1. Dicussed whether tickets should come in with a known total time and hidden tasks or completely blank. The first option will ensure the project manager does not have too much to do and is not unfairly the best role in the game. The second option means the 'Plan' room will have workstations.
1. Should each game played be represented as an entire project or just a sprint? **This will be decided later**
1. Implement a grid-based movement
1. Make the tickets physical objects
1. Alex, Kahu and Anthony are going to primarily work on front end. Nate, Joseph and Rene will primarily work on the back end.
1. Had a discussion on whether game state needs to be stored in a database or not. The discussion reuslted in us deciding game state data does not need to be stored in a database and it will just be stored in program variable instnaces 
1. Rene, Anthony and Alex had the idea that the game has pre defined levels. This means that the type of tickets and when they arrive should be pre determinded and designed by us in a way that means each level is feasible, a good amount of challege without being impossible. 

This is the mock paper version of the game we made and used in this meeting
