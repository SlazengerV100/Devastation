## Motivation

Effective project management is essential in todayâ€™s world, and Kanban is a widely-used method that helps manage projects efficiently. However, many first-year university students studying Software Engineering (SWEN) or Cybersecurity (CYBR) are not familiar with Kanban. This is because there aren't enough practical and engaging tools to teach them. Current teaching methods for Kanban at the introductory level of SWEN and CYBR programs are limited, causing students to miss out on valuable knowledge they will need later on. This lack of understanding can make it hard for them to use Kanban effectively in real-world situations. Our project aims to fill this gap by creating a game that teaches Kanban in a fun and interactive way. Research shows that gamification is a great tool for learning, making complex ideas easier to understand and remember. Our game will provide an immersive experience that mirrors real Kanban workflows, making learning enjoyable and practical. By playing our game, first-year SWEN and CYBR students will gain the skills they need to understand and use Kanban. This will help them be better prepared for future project management tasks and confident in applying Kanban principles in their careers. Our game will enhance their learning experience, making them more capable and adaptable in managing projects.

## Problem Statement

Many first-year Software Engineering (SWEN) and Cybersecurity (CYBR) university students struggle with key concepts in agile project management, particularly Kanban, due to the lack of engaging and practical learning experiences. This educational gap results in lower project management knowledge in group projects, which are essential throughout their courses, and leaves students without appealing tools to effectively learn and apply these methodologies. Our project aims to address this issue by developing an interactive and collaborative game that will provide a fun and immersive way for students to understand and use Kanban principles, ultimately better preparing them for future project management challenges.
