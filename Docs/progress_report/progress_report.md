## Problem Statement

Many first-year Software Engineering (SWEN) and Cybersecurity (CYBR) university students struggle with key concepts in agile project management, particularly Kanban, due to the lack of engaging and practical learning experiences. This educational gap results in lower project management knowledge in group projects, which are essential throughout their courses, and leaves students without appealing tools to effectively learn and apply these methodologies. Our project aims to address this issue by developing an interactive and collaborative game that will provide a fun and immersive way for students to understand and use Kanban principles, ultimately better preparing them for future project management challenges.
